<p>Prince is a computer program that converts XML and HTML into PDF documents
by way of CSS. Prince runs on major operating platforms such as
Windows, Linux, and MacOS X. For extensive information about Prince, please visit <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.princexml.com">www.princexml.com</a></p>

<h2 id="using">Using Prince</h2>
    
<p>Run Prince from the Start Menu item "Prince", or by double-clicking
on the Prince icon on your desktop.</p>

<p>The main window has five tab pages, making it easy for you to
navigate through different areas of the application.</p>
    
<h3>1. Documents Page</h3>

<p>You can add documents here for conversion. Although the default
document types are .xml, .xhtml, .html or .htm, Prince does not really
care about the file extension as long as it is a valid XML document.
To get started, you can find <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.princexml.com/samples/">sample documents</a> on our website.</p>

<p>Once a document has been added, you start the conversion process by
clicking on the <span class="button">Go</span> button. Once a document is processed and a PDF
file is produced successfully, its status will change to "Converted".
The output PDF file is saved in the same directory as the input XML
document.
</p>

<p>If the status of the currently selected document is "Converted", an
icon representing the PDF file produced from that document will be
displayed on the right hand side of the page. You can click on the
<span class="button">View</span> button to view it.</p>

<p>The status of a document can be one of the following three:</p>

<ul>	
<li>Unconverted: no attempts have be made to convert it</li>
<li>Converted: document has been converted successfully</li>
<li>Unsuccessful: conversion has been unsuccessful and no PDF file was produced</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view the output log on the Output Log page for details of the conversion.</p>


<h3>2. Style sheets Page</h3>

<p>This page is used to apply CSS style sheets to documents. If your
document references style sheets, these style sheets will be applied
automatically and there is no need to use this page.</p>

<h3>3. Configuration Page</h3>

<p>On this page you can select a document type for the document to be converted
and enter encryption information if you want to
encrypt the PDF file for security reasons. Encryption key can be 40
bits or 128 bits. Note that not all PDF viewers support encryption.</p>
<p>By default the document type will be auto-detected, which should work fine for most
XML and HTML documents.</p>


<h3>4. Output Log Page</h3>

<p>The Output Log page displays the messages Prince produced during the
conversion. Messages are categorized into three major groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information: general information the user might be interested in</li>
<li>Warning: minor problems encountered during conversion</li>
<li>Error: problems that have had a major impact on the conversion</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Preview Page</h3>

<p>When a PDF file is successfully produced, it can be viewed on this
page. You will need to have Acrobat Reader installed on your computer
to be able to use this feature. You can view one PDF file at a time.
The previous PDF file will be closed when you open and view a new one.
The <span class="button">View</span> button appears on the lower right hand side of the
Documents page when you click on a document that has a status of
"Converted".</p>

The License window can be brought up from the License menu item in the
Help menu. You can simply drag and drop the license file to this
window from whatever location you might have saved it (or you can use
the <span class="button">Open</span> button to open it if you are not used to drag-and-drop).
Read the license details. If you agree with the license, press the
<span class="button">Accept</span> button to activate the new license for Prince.</p>
